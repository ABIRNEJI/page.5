                <h1> Points (or The Five Points) was a 19th-century neighborhood in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lower Manhattan</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a>. The neighborhood was
                generally defined as being bound by Centre Street to the west, the Bowery to the east, Canal Street to the
                north, and Park Row to the south. Through the twentieth century, the former Five Points area was gradually
                redeveloped, with streets changed or closed. The area is now occupied by the Civic Center to the west and
                south, which includes major federal, state, and city facilities, and the African Burial Ground National Monument.
                To the east and north, former Five Points area is located within Chinatown.
